Description: Infer PAR-CLIP induced transitions and discriminate them from sequencing error, SNPs, contaminants and additional non-experimental causes, using a non-parametric mixture model. wavClusteR resolves cluster boundaries at high resolution and provides robust estimation of cluster statistics. In addition, the package allows to integrate RNA-Seq data to estimate FDR over the entire range of relative substitution frequencies. Furthermore, the package provides post-processing of results and functions to export results for UCSC genome browser visualization and motif search analysis. Key functions support parallel multicore computing. While wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it can be applied to the analysis of other Next-Generation Sequencing data obtained from substitution inducing experimental procedures (e.g. BisSeq)
