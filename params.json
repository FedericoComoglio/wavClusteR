{"name":"wavClusteR","tagline":"An R package for PAR-CLIP data analysis","body":"Introduction\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis R/BioConductor package for PAR-CLIP data analysis can be used to:\r\n\r\n+ Infer PAR-CLIP induced transitions and discriminate them from sequencing error, SNPs, contaminants and additional non-experimental causes, using a non-parametric mixture model. \r\n+ Resolve cluster boundaries at high resolution and provide robust estimation of cluster statistics\r\n+ Integrate RNA-Seq data to estimate False Discovery Rates over the entire range of relative substitution frequencies. \r\n+ Post-processing of results and functions to export results for UCSC genome browser visualization and motif search analysis. \r\n\r\nKey functions *support parallel multicore computing*. While wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it *can be applied to the analysis of other Next-Generation Sequencing data obtained from substitution inducing experimental procedures* (e.g. BisSeq).
