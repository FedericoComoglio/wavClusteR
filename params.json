Irradiation with UV light (365 nm) is then used to covalently cross link the photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. The cross linked RNA-RBP complexes are then isolated by immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest and the coimmunoprecipitated RNA released by protein degradation. The resulting RNA is converted into a cDNA library and the identity of the RNA molecules is determine by next-generation sequencing (NGS). \r\n\r\nOver the past five years, the PAR-CLIP protocol has been widely used to identify the binding sites of several known RBPs and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes. However, PAR-CLIP data analysis is not straightforward and dedicated methods are required to control false discovery rates.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n-------\r\n\r\nwavClusteR is an R/BioConductor package for PAR-CLIP data analysis can be used to:\r\n\r\n+ Infer PAR-CLIP induced transitions and discriminate them from sequencing errors, SNPs, contaminants and additional non-experimental causes, using a non-parametric mixture model (Sievers et al, 2012).\r\n+ Resolve protein binding sites (clusters) at high resolution.\r\n+ Rank clusters for downstream analyses and validation based on a solid statistical framework.\r\n+ Integrate total RNA-Seq data, if available, to estimate false discovery rates.\r\n+ Post-processing of clusters, including annotation of protein binding sites, data export in common UCSC formats and motif search analysis. \r\n\r\nThe package *supports multicore computing*. While wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it can be adapted to the analysis of other NGS data from experimental procedures exploting nucleotide substitutions for site detection (e.g. BisSeq). \r\n\r\nVersion\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCurrent stable version is 2.0\r\n\r\nDownload and Installation\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo install wavClusteR from BioConductor, start R (>3.1.0) and enter:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nsource(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(\"wavClusteR\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install the latest (devel) version of the package, either install it from BioC devel or directly from this GitHub repository with:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(repo = 'FedericoComoglio/wavClusteR')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe package provides a vignette detailing all steps required to analyze your PAR-CLIP data.
